Hello~ This game's html and css files were premade, but all the javascript is self written :-)

How to play this 2-player game:
1. Find a buddy
2. On your turn, keep rolling the dice until you want to hold/save your score to your total score.
3. Whoever gets 100 points or more, wins!
4. However, if you roll a 1, your current score resets to 0 (Not your total score).
5. Have fun :-)
